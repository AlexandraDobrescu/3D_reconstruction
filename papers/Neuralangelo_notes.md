## Key Concepts

**Rendering** is the process of creating an image from a 3D model.

| Volume Rendering | View Synthesis |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <center>3D discretely sampled dataset<br>  $	\downarrow$ <br> 2D projection</center> | <center> Set of 2D images<br>  $	\downarrow$ <br> 3D view</center> |
| RGB $\alpha$ color  RGB color| Given a series of images <br>  taken from different <br> perspectives $\rightarrow$ depth |

**Neural radiance fields (NeRFs)** are a technique that generates 3D representations of an object or scene from 2D images by using advanced machine learning.
